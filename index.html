                            In addition to my passion for technology and development, I love to immerse myself in a
                            variety
                            of activities that I am passionate about. Each hobby offers me a different way to express
                            myself, and also allows me to disconnect, learn new skills and simply enjoy life in a
                            different
                            way. Here I tell you a little more about the activities that fill my days with joy and
                            creativity.

I believe that if someone can imagine something, there's likely another person already working on it, and even another who is teaching it. I love learning from various sources, as all knowledge is valuable and can be found in both traditional media and unexpected places.">

I love having them close by and discovering new adventures in my free time, although my adult life leaves little time for this. I also enjoy audiobooks, so I'm not sure if my love lies more in reading or simply listening to stories. One of my favorite authors is H.P. Lovecraft, and some of his books that I cherish are The Strange Case of Charles Dexter Ward, The Shadow Over Innsmouth, and The Dunwich Horror.">

They not only occupy a part of my time but also channel and express much of my energy and emotions. I currently enjoy playing World of Warcraft and exploring various games on the Steam platform. Additionally, I've spent countless hours on League of Legends (unsuccessfully).">

I have a particular fondness for science fiction, psychological thrillers, and mystery films, as well as animation and fantasy movies. Watching movies is also the perfect excuse to enjoy some popcorn.">

Music, on the other hand, is a fundamental part of my daily life; I am keenly aware of its impact on me. I use it as a valuable tool: it helps me relax, concentrate while studying, and boost my energy when needed.">

I appreciate how you can transform a few torn pieces of fabric into something beautiful that can be given as a gift. I like the idea of creating such items for my loved ones.">
